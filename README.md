MIDI is a file format which is used to communicate musical information between devices. I recently picked 
up Music Production as a hobby, and i'm using MIDI all the time. I was curious to see how this worked, so 
I found the MIDI spec online and got to work!

This project provides a C++ class, which takes a MIDI file path as an input and prints the note contents
of that file to the console in a readable format. To clarify, all the MIDI interpetation is done from 
scratch, no third party libraries used. All standard C++!
